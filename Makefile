# To use the above makefile to compile your java programs:
# create a file named 'makefile' in your homework directory with the identical contents
# modify the CLASSES macro so that it has the names of your .java files;
# run 'make', and if all goes well, it should compile all your java source files that need to be re-built.
# Here is the same makefile, with comments explaining each line:



#
# define compiler and compiler flag variables
#

JFLAGS = -g
JC = javac


#
# Clear any default targets for building .class files from .java files; we
# will provide our own target entry to do this in this makefile.
# make has a set of default targets for different suffixes (like .c.o)
# Currently, clearing the default for .java.class is not necessary since
# make does not have a definition for this target, but later versions of
# make may, so it doesn't hurt to make sure that we clear any default
# definitions for these
#

.SUFFIXES: .java .class


#
# Here is our target entry for creating .class files from .java files
# This is a target entry that uses the suffix rule syntax:
#	DSTS:
#		rule
#  'TS' is the suffix of the target file, 'DS' is the suffix of the dependency
#  file, and 'rule'  is the rule for building a target
# '$*' is a built-in macro that gets the basename of the current target
# Remember that there must be a < tab > before the command line ('rule')
#

.java.class:$(JC) $(JFLAGS) $*.java


#
# CLASSES is a macro consisting of 4 words (one for each java source file)
#

CLASSES = \
DashboardForm.java \
LoginForm.java \
RegistrationForm.java \
UserForm.java \
Day.java \
Food.java \

# the default make target entry
#

#
# This target entry uses Suffix Replacement within a macro:
# $(name:string1=string2)
# 	In the words in the macro named 'name' replace 'string1' with 'string2'
# Below we are replacing the suffix .java of all words in the macro CLASSES
# with the .class suffix
#

classes:$(CLASSES:.java=.class)


#
# RM is a predefined macro in make (RM = rm -f)
